The use of 3rd party programs (Aimbot, ESP, etc.), bugs, and/or glitches/exploits will not be tolerated. If the admin receives reports about a player or tribe an investigation will be initiated.\n\nNO INSIDE RAIDING\n\nKeep Foundation/Pillar spamming to a minimum\n\nPlatform saddle drivers must be pickable (uncovered)\n\nKeep chat mature. (NO Racial slurs, homophobic insults, spamming, etc)\n\nNo 123, Human, (Default) Names\n\nArtifact cave base building is NOT permitted. (Temporary structures are allowed, NO Turrets)\n\nPrisoners may be kept for up to 30 minutes. The captive player must announce to an admin via Discord to start the timer. Failure to do so may delay your release.\n\nDestroy ALL taming pens (spikes, walls, etc.) when you are finished taming. This reduces server lag and keeps the admins from having to clean them up. (We HATE cleaning!)\n\nNo excessive harassment. The admins will determine if something is considered harassment or normal PvP. (In saying this, it is your responsibility to keep your dinos safe)\n\nNo building near the top of Volcano\n\nNo tree platforms near the redwoods artifact cave entrance (if your turrets become a problem because you built too close, they will be removed)\n\nNo building on icebergs that have penguin spawns\n\nNo building on Obelisks\n\nNo building to block major resource areas. (Resource Mountains, Major Penguin spawns, etc) ((Temporary strucutures are OK Ex: Taming Pens))\n\n\nRaiding:\n\nIf you are raiding, only destroy/kill what is necessary to obtain any desired loot.. Anything that is locked is fair game. That said, collateral damage (within reason) happens.\n\nPrisoners of war (during raids only) may be kept until completion of the raid.\\nnRaids against a tribe may be conducted for a period of 6 hours max. The timer starts when any explosive device is used against the defending tribe. You must have the intent to infiltrate and loot the defending tribes base when a raid is initiated.\n\nClean up raid structures (FOB) In a timely manner after the raid ends.\n\nKilling of passive dinos within a base without the intent of raiding can be considered harassment. (Playes and dinos on neutral/agressive are fair game!)\n\nAs hard as we try admins can not be on 24/7/365. If there is ever an issue and an admin is nowhere to be found ...SCREENSHOT IT! As we say “pics or it didn’t happen.”\n\nAdmin's will not replace items / dinos lost due to bugs in the game. A search for dinos that have fallen through the world will be conducted. The dino(s) will be retrieved if possible.",
